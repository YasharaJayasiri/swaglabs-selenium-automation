#SwagLabs Website Automation Project

#Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Selenium WebDriver automation** of the SwagLabs e-commerce website.  
It automates the full user journey including both positive and negative paths: login, product selection, cart management, checkout, and order completion.  
The tests are written in Java using TestNG, managed with Maven in IntelliJ IDEA.  

This project was originally developed in 2024 and is now shared to showcase my automation testing skills.
